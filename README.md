# LANGTON'S ANT

A simulation of **Langton's Ant** using **SFML 2.6.2**.

Langton's Ant is a simple two-dimensional universal Turing machine with very simple rules but complex emergent behavior.  
The "ant" moves on a grid of black and white squares and follows these steps:

1. At a white square, turn 90° right, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit.
2. At a black square, turn 90° left, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit.

Despite these simple rules, the ant exhibits chaotic patterns and eventually builds a highway.
